## Overview
Recommender system is one of the most popular topics in data science nowadays. Industry leaders in recommender system, such as Amazon and Netflix, have spent years R&D and benefit from it siginificantly. Taking Amazon for example, [recommender system is credited for 35% of total revenues and 29% growth in sales. And for Netflix, up to 75% of content viewed comes from its recommender system and this system saves 1 billion marketing cost each year.](https://sigmoidal.io/recommender-systems-recommendation-engine/)

For this project, I will be using following models and try to build a recommender system for articles on CI&T DeskDrop. 
* Popularity model: recommend based on popularity
* Content-based model: recognize and recommend similar content 
* Collaborative model: personalized based on user behaviour 
* Hybrid model: combined model
* Convolutional Neural Network: machine learning model
