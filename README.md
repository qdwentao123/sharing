## Overview
Recommender system is one of the most popular topics in data science nowadays. Industry leaders in recommender system, such as **Amazon** and **Netflix**, have spent years R&D and benefit from it siginificantly.

Taking Amazon for example:
> **recommender system is credited for 35% of total revenues and 29% growth in sales. And for Netflix, up to 75% of content viewed comes from its recommender system and this system saves 1 billion marketing cost each year.**

## Methodology 
For this project, I will be using following models and try to build a recommender system for articles on CI&T DeskDrop. 
* **Popularity model**: recommend based on popularity
* **Content-based model**: recognize and recommend similar content 
* **Collaborative model**: personalized based on user behaviours 
* **Hybrid model**: combined model
* **Convolutional Neural Network**: machine learning model
